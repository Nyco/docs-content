Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS) tool, that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
Each containers is isolated the others and each of them bundles their own software, libraries and configuration files. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the services of a single operating system kernel. This reduces unnecessary overhead and makes them lightweight and portable.
Docker containers can run on any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux, either on-premises or in a public cloud environment, such as Scaleway Elements.

All [Scaleway GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) come with prebuilt AI Docker images, using an environment based on Pipenv. 
As mentioned earlier, Docker images are portable and you can also run images provided by other sources and use them with the GPU (for instance Docker images from Nvidia, Google, ...).

# Running Docker containers 

A Docker container can be launched using the command `docker run`. It is required to specify at least an image to derive the container from when using the command. 

```sh
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG|@DIGEST] [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

An image developer can define image defaults related to:

detached or foreground running
container identification
network settings
runtime constraints on CPU and memory
