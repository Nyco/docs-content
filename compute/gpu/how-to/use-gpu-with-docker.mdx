Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS) tool, that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
Each containers is isolated the others and each of them bundles their own software, libraries and configuration files. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the services of a single operating system kernel. This reduces unnecessary overhead and makes them lightweight and portable.
Docker containers can run on any computer running macOS, Windows, or Linux, either on-premises or in a public cloud environment, such as Scaleway Elements.

All [Scaleway GPU Instances](https://www.scaleway.com/en/gpu-instances/) come with prebuilt AI Docker images, using an environment based on Pipenv. 
As mentioned earlier, Docker images are portable and you can also run images provided by other sources and use them with the GPU (for instance Docker images from Nvidia, Google, ...).

## Most common Docker commands 

Below you find a list of the most common commands you use when dealing with Docker containers:

| Command       | Usage                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                              |

| docker login  | `docker login`                                               | This command is used to login to Docker's default repository (Docker Hub)                                                                                |
| docker pull   | `docker pull <docker_image>`                                 | This command is used to pull images from the Docker Hub.                                                                                                 |
| docker run    | `docker run -it -d <docker_image>`                           | This command is used to create a container from an image.                                                                                                |

| docker exec   | `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`                        | This command is used to access the `bash` command prompt on a running container with the ID `<container_id>`.                                            |
| docker stop   | `docker stop <container_id>`                                 | This command is used to stop a running container with the ID `<container_id>`. This command allows the container to shut down gracefully.                |
