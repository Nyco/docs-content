## Load Balancer Overview

The [Private Network](/network/vpc/quickstart/) feature enables you to build a virtual L2 network between your cloud ressources. The service is compatible with a wide range of cloud ressources including: 
* [Instances](/compute/instances/quickstart/)
* [Elastic Metal servers](/compute/elastic-metal/quickstart/)
* [Managed Database](/storage/database/quickstart/)
* [Load Balancers](/en/docs/network/load-balancer/quickstart/)

and more. [Public Gateways](/network/vpc/concepts/#public-gateway), enabling IP autoconfiguration of your Private Networks and their communication with the Internet.

In this tutorial we are going to create a [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) cluster on two Elastic Metal servers, inside a Private Network. We use a Load Balancer to disbribute the load on virtual machines hosted on our Elastic Metal servers and configure an application that uses a Managed Database for MySQL to store its data.

## Preparing Proxmox

To be able to use the Private Network of the Elastic Metal server on several VM's a bridge is required. Bridges are like physical network switches implemented in software. Once the bridge is created, create a Cluster that communicates over the bridge using the Private Network.

1. Log into the Proxmox web interface and select your server in the datacenter view. Then click **Network** in the menu.

2. Click **Create** > **Linux Bridge**. The configuration wizard displays. Enter private IP for your Elastic Metal server in CIDR format. The **Bridge port** is the name of your primary network interface, followed by a dot and your VLAN-ID. Tick the boxes **Autostart** and **VLAN aware**, then click **Create** to create the bridge.

3. Click **Apply configuration** to activate the new configuration.

4. Go to the **Datacenter** view and click **Create Cluster**. 

5. Enter a name for the cluster and select your Private Network brdige `vmbr1` as cluster network. Then click **Create** to lauch cluster creation. 

6. Select the cluster in the cluster list and click **Join Information**. The cluster join information displays.

7. Click **Copy Information** to copy the cluster join information into the clipboard. 

8. Go to the Proxmox interface of your second node and click **Cluster** to enter the cluster configuration from the Datacenter view of the machine. 

9. Click **Join Cluster** and paste the cluster join information in the form. 

10. Enter your first nodes `root` password and click **Join** to link the machine to the cluster. 

The second node appears now in the cluster in the Datacenter view of Proxmox. You can manage both machines using a single interface. The communication between members of the cluster is entirely in your Private Network, ensuring the highest level of security and the lowest latency. 

## Creating Virtual Machines

Proxmox is capable of managing Linux Kernel Virtual Machines (KVM) as well as LXC containers. KVM provides full virtualization for complete Windows and Linux images whilst LXC containers are lightweight and perfect to run conflict-free Linux applications. 
Follow this guide for information how to [configure virtual machines and LXC containers on Proxmox](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/tutorials/configure-failover-proxmox/).

Create or clone your virtual machines on both servers of the cluster to distibute the load between them using a Load Balancer. Your virtual machines can use the Public Gateway and dynamic NAT to communicate with the Internet for downloads and updates. If you want to expose certains ports of your VM's directly, configure [static NAT rules](/network/vpc/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-review-and-configure-nat)) for them. 


<Message type="tip">

  Make sure to select the bridge `vmbr1`, automatic MAC address generation and select DHCP for LXC network configuration.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-px-create-vm.png" alt="" />

  The DCHP server in your Private Network will automatically assign a random IP address to your container or VM. If required, you can configure [static NAT](/network/vpc/how-to/configure-a-public-gateway/#how-to-review-and-configure-dhcp) to assign a static IP address to it.

## Configuring the Load Balancer

1. Go to the [Load Balancers](https://console.scaleway.com/load-balancer/lbs/) section in the Scaleway console and select the Load Balancer you want configure.

2. Click the **Frontends** tab, then **+ Add Frontend**. The frontend configuration wizard displays.

3. Enter the following information:
